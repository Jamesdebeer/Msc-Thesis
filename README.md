Msc Thesis - Exploring the application of Natural Language processing to scientific medical cannabis publications

ABSTRACT:

Cannabis has become recognised internationally as a powerful medicinal plant. The explosion of clinical research on cannabis has made it difficult for researchers and medical
professionals to keep up to date with new findings. Analyzing the large quantities of available text data using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms could improve the speed and accuracy at which cannabis research is processed, as well as expose hitherto unknown correlations between cannabis compounds and the treatment
of health conditions. In turn, this would help direct future research and clinical. trials. This thesis aims to develop an appropriate method to extract the key correlations
between cannabis compounds, human physiology and disease from the existing medical literature. First, natural language processing techniques (such as document clustering
and topic modelling, global vector word embeddings and supervised document classifies) are used to group 500 journal articles from the general literature on cannabis according
to broad research topics; analyse the interaction between cannabis compounds, human physiology and diseases; and train a classifier to classify unseen documents. Second,
the correlations generated through this quantitative process are assessed qualitatively against those in a manual dataset of research findings from more than 500 studies
collated over a number of years and provided by a medical company specialising in cannabis research. The results indicate that the methods and working code developed
were able to effectively and accurately demonstrate correlation and reproducibility of results. This was shown by the close similarity of ranked target variable to disease
correlations. The unsupervised methods were able to effectively cluster and model topic distributions between the data to group documents by topic, while the supervised
learning methods were able to accurately train models based on these suggestions, thereby solving a real-world practical problem in data management and analysis. The
approach has potential for directing researchers towards priority areas for new research and clinical trials, optimising their time and reducing edundant research. The validity
of the results need to be tested through clinical trials
